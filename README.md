# Audiophille E-Commerce ‚Äì Playwright Tests

End-to-end UI automation for:  
https://sameh-abdelhalem.github.io/audiophille-ecommerce/

## Highlights

- Playwright + TypeScript
- Page Object Model + PageManager
- Cross browser (Chromium / Firefox / WebKit)
- Cart, product, checkout (incl. e‚ÄëMoney) coverage
- Responsive smoke coverage (mobile + tablet projects) via `responsive.spec.ts`
- Tags: @smoke @ui @positive @negative @regression
- Utilities: parsePrice, PaymentMethod enum

## Structure

```
pages/        page objects
tests/        spec files (includes responsive.spec.ts)
fixtures/     test data + enums
utils/        helpers (price, device form-factor helpers)
playwright.config.ts
```

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```

Run subset:

```bash
npx playwright test -g "@smoke"
```

Headed:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium
```

## Allure Reports

Allure reporter is enabled in playwright.config.ts.

- Install (if not already):

```bash
npm i -D allure-playwright allure-commandline
```

- Run tests (produces ./allure-results):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

- Generate HTML report:

```bash
npx allure generate ./allure-results --clean -o ./allure-report
```

- Open report locally:

```bash
npx allure open ./allure-report
# or
npx allure serve ./allure-results
```

Optional package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "playwright test",
    "allure:gen": "allure generate ./allure-results --clean -o ./allure-report",
    "allure:open": "allure open ./allure-report",
    "allure:serve": "allure serve ./allure-results"
  }
}
```

CI tips:

- Upload ./allure-report as an artifact, or host via GitHub Pages.
- Ensure the job runs `npx playwright test` before `npx allure generate`.

## Responsive Layer

Supported additional projects (configured in `playwright.config.ts`):

- `mobile-chromium-pixel7`
- `mobile-webkit-iphone14`
- `tablet-chromium-ipad`

Only `responsive.spec.ts` runs under these projects (scoped with `testMatch`) to keep the matrix fast.

Run full desktop regression (all standard specs):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run only responsive smoke (all responsive projects, just the responsive spec):

```bash
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chromium-pixel7
npx playwright test --project=mobile-webkit-iphone14
npx playwright test --project=tablet-chromium-ipad
```

Run a single responsive test across all responsive projects:

```bash
npx playwright test responsive.spec.ts
```

Tag strategy:

- Core specs use existing tags (@smoke, @ui, etc.)
- Responsive spec additionally implies layout validation; add `@responsive` if later filtering is desired.

Extending responsive:

- Add new device: append a project with `testMatch: "responsive.spec.ts"`.
- Promote a desktop test to responsive: copy critical assertion into `responsive.spec.ts` (keep it lean).

## Common Tags

| Tag         | Use                |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| @smoke      | Fast critical path |
| @regression | Wider coverage     |
| @ui         | DOM / visual       |
| @positive   | Happy flow         |
| @negative   | Validation         |

## Key Pages Covered

- Product details (content + imagery)
- Cart (add, multi-item, quantity, pricing, persistence)
- Checkout (billing, payment selection, e‚ÄëMoney validation, confirmation modal)

## Utilities

| Utility / Enum              | Purpose                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `parsePrice(text)`          | Strips currency / formatting ‚Üí number  |
| `PaymentMethod` enum        | Avoids repeating payment strings       |
| `PageManager`               | Central page accessor factory          |
| `isMobile()` / `isTablet()` | Form factor guards in responsive tests |

## Flakiness Mitigation

- waitForReadyState
- cartPage.waitForReady
- openFirstProduct helper
- Prefer expect(...).toBeVisible() over manual timeouts

## Future Ideas

Add:

- Full checkout happy path on one mobile device
- Visual regression only on `mobile-chromium-pixel7`

Short by design. Add depth only if a reviewer asks.
npx playwright install
npx playwright test

````

Headed mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium
````

Single test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/cart.spec.ts
```

Specific test by title:

```bash
npx playwright test -g "Checkout confirmation"
```

## üîê Checkout Coverage Highlights

- Billing form required fields
- Payment method selection (e‚ÄëMoney vs Cash)
- Conditional e‚ÄëMoney Number & PIN validation
- Order confirmation modal + grand total extraction (`parsePrice`)

---

## üõí Cart Coverage Highlights

- Empty state + disabled checkout
- Single & multiple product add
- Quantity update (+ / -) and removal logic
- Price recalculation after quantity change
- Multi‚Äëproduct decrement to removal
- Persistence during navigation

## üß© Utilities

| Utility / Enum       | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `parsePrice(text)`   | Strips currency / formatting ‚Üí number   |
| `PaymentMethod` enum | Eliminates string literals in tests     |
| `PageManager`        | Central page accessor (avoids new spam) |

---

## üõ° Flakiness Mitigation

| Technique                  | Example                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Explicit readiness wait    | `waitForReadyState("domcontentloaded")` |
| Component readiness (cart) | `cartPage.waitForReady()`               |
| Stable product access      | `categoryPage.openFirstProduct()`       |
| Avoid arbitrary timeouts   | Using `expect(...).toBeVisible()`       |
| Controlled visual runs     | `VISUAL` gating                         |

---

## ‚ûï Adding a New Test (Example)

```ts
test("‚úÖ Product price parses as number @ui", async ({ page }) => {
  const pm = new PageManager(page);
  await pm.onHomePage().navigateToCategory("speakers");
  await pm.onCategoryPage().openFirstProduct();
  const priceText = await pm.onProductPage().productPrice.textContent();
  // reuse parsePrice if imported
});
```

## üß™ CI Suggestions (If Added)

Typical GitHub Actions steps:

1. Checkout
2. Install dependencies + browsers (`npx playwright install --with-deps`)
3. Run smoke: `npx playwright test -g "@smoke"`
4. Run full regression
5. Optionally run `VISUAL=1` job (Chromium only)

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Update browsers          | `npx playwright install`                |

## üîç Troubleshooting

| Symptom                             | Fix                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeout clicking first product      | Ensure `openFirstProduct()` is used                             |
| Checkout button disabled in Firefox | Use `cartPage.waitForReady()`                                   |
| Visual job slow                     | Disable VISUAL (remove env var)                                 |
| Price assertion failing             | Confirm price text matches `$ 1234` pattern                     |
| Element not found after navigation  | Insert `waitForReadyState("domcontentloaded")` after navigation |

## üß≠ Design Choices (Brief)

- **PageManager**: Centralizes lazy instantiation, reduces test boilerplate.
- **Minimal BasePage**: Only essential helpers to avoid abstraction bloat.
- **Targeted Visuals**: Only capture UI checkpoints that matter (hero/product/cart/checkout).
- **Defensive Locators**: Prefer role/text-backed queries over brittle CSS where possible.
- **Tagging**: Enables selective pipelines (smoke vs regression vs visual).

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Accessibility smoke (axe-core)
- API layer + contract validation
- Visual diff gating in PR workflow
- Data builder for negative billing cases
- Mobile viewport matrix
